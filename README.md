# JournalApp

On February 2nd 2018 I decided to begin journaling. I started writing in .txt files on my computer using a template format. I thought that i would be more efficient to create a web app to manage this journal for me. This way my journal can be accessable on all devices. It will also make the writing process much faster on a daily basis. It uses JQuery on the front end and NodeJS as a backend. Daily Entries will be saved as JSON Files.

## Getting Started

Install NodeJS
run Node with Main.js as your entry point.
The app should now be viewable in browser, for local machines the default address in 127.0.0.1 on port 3000

## Built With

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - the web server used
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) - The web framework used
